# IAT445-NSIAF
Shared repo for Not Seeing Is A Flower (Spring 2026)

## Notes:
- Always make changes in a branch, not in main (even for adding assets just for clarity)
- Make your own personal testing scenes when trying to figure out new mechanics
- Communicate with each other on what parts we are working on!


## Quickstart guide to using github:
1. Make a new branch (if you do this through the GitHub website, you don't need to publish it. If you do it on Github desktop, you will need to publish it before others can see the branch)
2. Do your changes/testing/assets in that branch
3. **Commit** you changes to the branch. Your changes are saved to the branch, but they're still local, not in the remote respository (this thing)
4. **Push** your commits to the repo. Now other people can see your changes in the branch and access them.

------------------Merging branches to main------------------------

The number one rule: Don't merge branches into main without teling anyone!!!

1. Create pull request. This can be done both in the website or the desktop app (will direct you to website)
2. Merge pull request
3. Done! Changes are on main and you can close/delete the branch if you want to now.
